# DollDelivery

## Description

DollDelivery is a Scala implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.  The dijkstra function is a modified version of the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation found on rosettacode.com

This code implements the DollDelivery object, and inside of that object implements the findShortestPath function.  This function is called with a string that contains the starting location, a string that contains the ending location, and a list that contains a map of a start point, an end point, and the distance between the two.

Example input and the output expected from the example are as follows:

Input:

    startingLocation: "Kruthika's abode"

    targetLocation: "Craig's haunt"

    edges: 

    List(
      Map("startLocation" -> "Kruthika's abode", "endLocation" -> "Mark's crib", "distance" -> 9),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Kruthika's abode", "endLocation" -> "Greg's casa", "distance" -> 4),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Kruthika's abode", "endLocation" -> "Matt's pad", "distance" -> 18),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Kruthika's abode", "endLocation" -> "Brian's apartment", "distance" -> 8),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Brian's apartment", "endLocation" -> "Wesley's condo", "distance" -> 7),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Brian's apartment", "endLocation" -> "Cam's dwelling", "distance" -> 17),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Greg's casa", "endLocation" -> "Cam's dwelling", "distance" -> 13),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Greg's casa", "endLocation" -> "Mike's digs", "distance" -> 19),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Greg's casa", "endLocation" -> "Matt's pad", "distance" -> 14),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Wesley's condo", "endLocation" -> "Kirk's farm", "distance" -> 10),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Wesley's condo", "endLocation" -> "Nathan's flat", "distance" -> 11),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Wesley's condo", "endLocation" -> "Bryce's den", "distance" -> 6),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Matt's pad", "endLocation" -> "Mark's crib", "distance" -> 19),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Matt's pad", "endLocation" -> "Nathan's flat", "distance" -> 15),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Matt's pad", "endLocation" -> "Craig's haunt", "distance" -> 14),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Mark's crib", "endLocation" -> "Kirk's farm", "distance" -> 9),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Mark's crib", "endLocation" -> "Nathan's flat", "distance" -> 12),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Bryce's den", "endLocation" -> "Craig's haunt", "distance" -> 10),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Bryce's den", "endLocation" -> "Mike's digs", "distance" -> 9),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Mike's digs", "endLocation" -> "Cam's dwelling", "distance" -> 20),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Mike's digs", "endLocation" -> "Nathan's flat", "distance" -> 12),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Cam's dwelling", "endLocation" -> "Craig's haunt", "distance" -> 18),
      Map("startLocation" -> "Nathan's flat", "endLocation" -> "Kirk's farm", "distance" -> 3)
    )

Result:
  
    Map("distance" -> 31, "path" -> "Kruthika's abode => Brian's apartment => Wesley's condo => Bryce's den => Craig's haunt")
    

## Maven
This project is implemented as a maven package.  Running mvn install from the DollDelivery directory should download the necessary packages such as scalatest, compile the code, and run the tests.
